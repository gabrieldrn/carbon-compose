        Themes are used to modify existing components to fit a specific visual style. By using Carbonâ€™s tokens, developers can easily customize all of their components by changing a set of universal variables, eliminating the need to modify individual components.

        Themes serve as an organizational framework for color in Carbon, with each theme based on a specific primary background color. And they actually get their names from their background color.

        See [Themes guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/themes/overview/) for more information.
