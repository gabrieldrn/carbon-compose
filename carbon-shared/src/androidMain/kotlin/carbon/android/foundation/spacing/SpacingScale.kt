/**
 * The Carbon spacing scale complements the 2x Grid and typography scale by using multiples of two,
 * four, and eight. It includes both small increments needed to create appropriate spatial
 * relationships for detail-level designs as well as larger increments used to control the density
 * of a design. Each level of the spacing scale has its own token. Spacing tokens can be used inside
 * of components for building and between components for layout spacing.
 *
 * See [Spacing guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview/) for more
 * information.
