/**
 * # Carbon motion
 * (From [Motion guidelines](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview/))
 *
 * Carbon components have motion built in for microinteractions. However, the motion design of the
 * overarching UI — that is, how the components interact with each other and enter and exit the page
 * itself — is up to each product team to implement. Use this guidance to customize, combine,
 * coordinate, and choreograph this aspect of motion in the UI.
 *
 * ## Productive motion
 * Productive motion creates a sense of efficiency and responsiveness, while remaining subtle and
 * out of the way. Productive motion is appropriate for moments when the user needs to focus on
 * completing tasks. Microinteractions in Carbon such as button states, dropdowns, revealing
 * additional information, or rendering data tables and visualizations were all designed with
 * productive motion.
 *
 * ## Expressive motion
 * Expressive motion delivers enthusiastic, vibrant, and highly visible movement. Use expressive
 * motion for significant moments such as opening a new page, clicking the primary action button,
 * or when the movement itself conveys a meaning. System alerts and the appearance of notification
 * boxes are great cases for expressive motion.
